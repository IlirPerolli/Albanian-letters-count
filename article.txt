Abstract. Language is the basic and most
consummate way of communication between
people. It can be materialized in two ways:
spoken and written. Every society has a spoken
language, even the primitive ones. Although only
civilized societies have a written language with a
defined alphabet. The presence of letters in the
context of words determines the meaning, while
the determined order of these in words presents
a work of art.
It is, thus, understandable to raise the
question: Which letter is used the most and least
in different languages? Or maybe there is
similarity on their distribution even though it has
to do with languages which use different
alphabets? Or in general, which are the
differences or what could different languages
have in common when they interpret the same
content?! The answer to this question remains
within the scope of this paper.
Keywords. Language, Text, Alphabet, Analyse,
English, Albanian, Macedonian.
1. Introduction
Computer language software and their
presence on the Internet have become a vital part
of communication and modern concepts of the
so-called “scientific field”. Linguists have taken
seriously the provocation of the computer era in
the field of linguistics, because computer
linguistics is the only way for protecting,
enriching and advancing every language in the
world.
The aim of this research is to present the
continuous development of the languages,
including the statistical research component.
With the help of the original program, written in
C# programming language1
, and putting the
computer in service of different languages, text
with same content were written in English,
Albanian and Macedonian languages2
. Linguists
can use the gained results for further linguistics
research and analyses.
2. Classification of alphabet letters and
the specifics of computer based
processing
The classification of letters is specific for
every language. In our case, the English
language uses 26 Latin letters. The Albanian
alphabet consists of 36 letters. In this case,
beside the Latin letters, other double letters are
being used as well as two diacritic marks. Whilst,
the Macedonian language uses the Cyrillic
alphabet, which also differs from the other two
languages by the number of letters used (31).
Therefore, separate study of each language
specifics for computer based processing is
needed.
2.1. English language, the specifics of
computer based processing
All letters from the English alphabet are
available on a standard computer keyboard.
Therefore, for analytical text analysis, the
English language has a definite advantage
compared with other languages. All Latin letters
are included in the standard keyboard ASCII3
.
This represents another additional benefit, for
using various programming languages in

South East European University, Official languages: English,
Albanian and Macedonian
3 ASCII- American Standard Code for Information Interchange
preparing various applications for textual
processing. Just to illustrate, I will mention the
case of using C or C++ and C# programming
languages. If the text contains characters that are
not included in ASCII code, then we would
prefer to prepare the programming language by
using C# programming language, which
recognizes all characters included in UNICODE.
Otherwise, we would have the opportunity to
choose any language. The English language has
this advantage and all letters are presented in the
standard keyboard. Therefore, the process of
data entry and analysis of text, for many
languages are being treated as separate
processes, however concerning the English
language we have the feeling that they appear
as one.
2.2. Albanian language, the specifics of
computer based processing
The 36 letters of the Albanian language (Tab.
1) can be categorized in simple and compound
letters.

There are 27 simple letters in total and they
are represented with one symbol. Twenty-five of
them are from the Latin alphabet, whereas the
two letters “Ç ç” and “Ë ë” do not belong to the
Latin alphabet and are considered as letters that
possess diacritic signs. These two letters are
problematic for the usage of computers in
writing them and for performing analysis on
texts in Albanian language. The standard
keyboard contains only the 26 Latin characters,
so the compromise is found by using one of the
following options: keyboard configuration where
some additional Albanian language characters
are hidden within special keys like parentheses,
or installing fonts for text processors, or last
option is using codes for generation of these two
symbols.
The compound letters, also known as
bigrams, are formed by linking two Latin
characters in one single letter for representing a
single phoneme in Albanian language. These are
9 in total [4]:

These letters represent another challenge for
computer analysis, because the combination of
the two characters should be treated as a single
letter. Thus, one string should be treated as a
single letter. Usually the problem is solved by
implementing different algorithms in
programming.
Considering above-mentioned characteristics,
we can conclude that the existing software for
textual analysis of other languages, including
English language, cannot be used for thorough
analysis of the texts written in Albanian
language. For this reason, we do not have any
other choice than to use programming languages
and to write an original application specifically
for the textual analysis of the texts written in
Albanian language.
As for the standard keyboard, it can be freely
used for writing in the Albanian language. All
the Latin letters, 25 in total are located in
keyboard, whereas the 26th letter “W”, is not
needed. The compound letters can be written
using the combination of Latin characters. The
only problematic letters are the diacritic ones: “Ç
ç” and “Ë ë”, which can be generated directly
through character code.
2.3. Macedonian language, the specifics
of computer based processing
All letters of the Macedonian alphabet are not
included within the standard keyboards. This
represents additional difficulty in writing the
language as well as in using existing applications
for textual analyses. Out of 31 letters of the
alphabet, only 7 of them partially belong to the
Latin alphabet, while the others belong to
Cyrillic alphabet. Writing text on a computer is
always accompanied with installation of special
fonts and characters, or configuration of the
keyboard with Cyrillic alphabet support, which is
more preferred. This makes the way of text entry
very noticeable from the additional text
processing.
Some of the standard keys on the keyboard
which contain punctuation marks like:
semicolon, apostrophe, etc are replaced with
regular letters. Therefore, the usage of these
depends on changing the writing mode of the
keyboard. This has a negative impact on writing
continuity. In addition, the Cyrillic alphabet
letters are not included in ASCII code. This
disables the opportunity for using the existing
standard applications for textual analysis for the
mentioned language. For this reason, we use C#
programming language, because it has
UNICODE support and contains all letters of the
Macedonian language [11].
3. The application for textual analyses
Considering the specifics of the analyzed
languages, we have used “Microsoft Visual
Studio 2005” platform and C# programming
language within it to design a specific program,
which fulfills the needs for textual processing of
English, Albanian and Macedonian languages.
The source code for this program, used for
generating the results, is being completely
offered through this paper.
The program is called “Text Analyzer” (Fig.
1). This program totally answers the needs for
analyzing written texts in all three languages, and
can be very easily adapted for other languages.
It enables reading textual files, sets total number
of characters within the textual file (file with .txt
extension), counts every single letter,
punctuation marks and special characters
separately, like for example empty line, the use
of TAB and jumping on new line, etc. Also, it
enables direct calculation of letter appearance
frequency within the individual textual file.
Figure 1. Text analyzer
From Fig. 1, we can notice that the
application enables choosing one of the
languages for textual analyzes. In Fig. 2, we can
notice the evident benefits and characteristics,
which came as a result of the testing file.
Figure 2. The results offered “Text Analyzer”
application
For achieving accurate results, we analyzed
official texts from the South East European
University, because official and competent
people translate the texts with same content in
English, Albanian and Macedonian language.
Approximately, 150 pages were analyzed, with
around 250,000 characters. Such approach was
taken due to the lack of securing a bigger dataset.
Comparing with Languages within EU, where
you can find the same content in 20+ different
languages, like the case with dataset JRCAcquis, in the local languages such as Albanian
and Macedonian, it is very difficult to find
interpretations parallel to English. Therefore, in
order to have more truthful results, all texts are
categorized in 12 groups in content basis, such
as: statute, decisions, announcements etc, and the
average values of the results from these groups
are presented in this paper.
4. Textual analyzes results
The number of characters differs for analyzed
text documents with the same content, but in
different languages, such as in Albanian,
Macedonian and English languages. It is
interesting that the differences appear almost in
the same proportion if comparing the number of
characters used and the number of letters in each
alphabet. (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) In Albanian
language, 248,124 characters were used to write
text with the 36 letters in its alphabet. Second is
the Macedonian language with 241,933
characters and with 31 letters in its alphabet.
Third is the English language with 234,000
characters and with 26 letters in its alphabet.

Letters of alphabets
Figure 4. Number of letters used in the
alphabets
Based on the category of the characters, the
following classification was made:
 Letters,
 Punctuation marks,
 Spaces
 Other symbols
On this occasion, regarding the punctuation
marks, the following symbols were calculated: . ,
: ; ! ? ' „ – ( ).
Regarding the dispersion of these characters
among the analyzed three languages, we can
notice the same distribution for punctuation
marks and spaces for all three languages. This
was proved by the following achieved values for
the punctuation marks: Albanian: 2.42%,
Macedonian: 2.39% and English: 2.15%. Also,
the used spaces have the following order:
Albanian: 15.53%, Macedonian: 15.49% and
English: 15.41%. This helps us realize that from
the number of used words for the same content,
Albanian language is the first, because there
were used more spaces. Second is the
Macedonian language and third is English
language. So, again the language order is like the
one based on the number of alphabet letters.
By considering that the alphabet of every
language consists of vowels and consonants, it is
reasonable to see if there is a difference between
these three languages on this category. The
common thing is that all three languages use
same vowels: A, O, I, E and U. The Albanian
language uses two additional vowels: Y and Ë,
which makes seven the total number of vowels,
while the other two languages have five vowels
each. The proportion between the vowels and
consonants is shown in Tab. 3.
Table. 3. Proportion vowel/consonant
Alp. Alb Mk Eng
Con. 29 80.56% 26 83.87% 21 80.77%
Vow. 7 19.44% 5 16.13% 5 19.23%
Here we can see the same dispersion for those
languages that use the Latin alphabet, Albanian
and English, have similar proportions
consonant/vowel 81% with 19%. Less vowels
were used in Macedonian language, with
proportion approximately consonant/vowel 84%
with 16%. However, the results from the
analytical text analysis are very different.
Vowels mostly were used in written texts in
Macedonian language, 44.46% compared to
consonants. In the second place is the Albanian
language with 43. 95 %. Fewer vowels were used
in the English language 40.70 %. Out of this, we
can conclude that in acoustic aspect, the
Macedonian language is leading if compared to
Albanian and English.
The Macedonian language again differs from
the Albanian and English languages, because by
a measurable amount, 12.78 %, the vowel A is
being used. The other two languages have E as
their priority vowel: English with 12.98 % and
Albanian with 11.11 %. In Albanian language, it
is evident the usage of Ë with 9.37 %, while this
vowel does not exist in the other two languages.

As far as the application of frequency of
letters concerns, the use of the application brings
up different characteristics. For the Albanian
language, based on the textual analysis, the
following frequencies are generated, concerning
the appearance of the letters of the alphabet.
For the Macedonian language, following

Figure 7. Application frequency of letters in
English language
Based on the diagrams, we can notice that the
Macedonian language differs from the other
languages with more frequent application of
vowels. Out of five vowels, four of them are on
the top of the list among all letters of the
alphabet: A, O, И, E. Presented in percentage,
41.6 % of the written text in this language
consists of these four letters.
The Albanian and English languages have in
common the frequent application of the vowel
“E” and immediately after that the consonant “T”
[1]. Presented in percentage, 11.11 % (E) +
10.37 % (T), total 21.48 % of texts written in
Albanian are made by these two letters. It is
similar in English language, 12.98 % (E) + 9.79
% (T), total 22.77 % of texts written in English
are made by these two letters [9][10][12].
Out of these three diagrams we can generate a
list on the usage of the letters for all three
alphabets, together with frequencies and
percentage. Where you can see precisely which
letters and in what volume they are used in their
alphabets.
5. Conclusions
As a result of statistical analysis of the text
with the same content, but written in different
languages, Albanian, Macedonian, and English
language, we have drawn the following
conclusions:
 More characters are used for writing the
text in Albanian language, i.e. in the
language which has the most letters in the
alphabet (36). Followed by the
Macedonian language with 31 alphabets,
and the last – English language with
significantly less characters.
 Punctuation marks (approximately 2%)
and the other symbols “e tjera”
(approximately 3%) are in identical ratio
in all the three languages, in comparison
with the total number of characters.
 Spaces make up 15.53% of the total
number of characters in Albanian, and
when compared to the 15.49% in
Macedonian and 15.41% in English
language. We can conclude that in the
Albanian language there are more words
used for the same content, with
Macedonian language in the second place.
Finally, fewer words are needed for
interpreting the same content in English.
 The vowels vs. consonants ratio in
Albanian and English language is
approximately identical 19% vs. 81%,
whereas in Macedonian language this
ration is approximately 16% vs. 84%.
However, the results of this analysis show
that although this ratio is lower in
Macedonian language, 44.46% of the text
is consisted of vowels, compared to
43.95% in Albanian language and 40.70%
in English language.
 It is interesting that for the Macedonian
language that the four vowels “А”, “О”,
“И” and “Е” are used more often and
make up 41.6% of the total number of
characters. One common thing for the
Albanian and English language is that the
most used vowels are “E” and the
consonant “T” and they make up 21.48%
(Alb) or 22.77% (Eng) of the total number
of characters in the written texts in these
languages [9].
 In this research we have generated a rank
list for the usage of letters for the three
languages: Albanian, Macedonian and
English, together with their frequencies in
those languages. The results are compared
to the publications in English language
that are cited in this paper. Results are
identical or very similar, and depend on
the volume and content of the text, which
confirms the correctness of the used
application. When it comes to Albanian
and Macedonian language, it is difficult to
find other research in this field, i.e.
computer based language analysis, for
comparison purposes.
 The application designed in C#,
completely satisfies the requirements for
text processing written with English,
Albanian or Macedonian alphabet. Also, it
is easily modifiable and customizable for
textual analysis of other languages as well.
The source code of this computer program
is given in the appendix of this research
paper and can be freely used from the
interested parties.
